### UI
UI projects is generated by create-react-app v2. I also use:
- Redux
- Immutable
- SASS

#### Get topics
We will call getting topic apis right after the homepage component is mounted. This will trigger redux get topics action and dispatch event with data to reducer. Reducer will store it. Homepage component will connect to store and get the topics from reducer. Then display them.
#### Create topic
We will show a modal with a textarea when user click on "CREATE TOPIC" button. when user click on "Post" button, we will validate topic's content. If it is valid we will trigger create topic action to call create topic api. After created topic, we add it to topics instead of calling get topics api
#### Upvote/Downvote topic
We will trigger upvote/downvote action to call upvote/downvote api with topic's id when user click on upvote/downvote button. After upvoted/downvoted, we update topic's votes in topic vote to show new votes.
